# Contribution Guidelines

Thanks for you interest in LibPressio!  Here are a few things you can do to speed up the merging of you contribution.

## General Things


+ Please make sure that you have permission from your home institution to
  contribute code under the license for LibPressio.  This can take the form of
  a copyright assignment or a statement of policy + a written acknowledgment
  that you are contributing your code under the LibPressio license.
+ LibPressio maintains a linear history with version numbers for every change.
  Please squash all commits and update the version number appropriately as
  documented in the README.
+ Your code must pass all CI tests before it will be merged.
+ LibPressio code must compile with C++11.  This is to support some super
  computers that only have ancient compilers.  However, many of the C++14,17,
  and 20 library features have been backported in the `compat` namespace.  Feel
  free to use these.

## Plugins

LibPressio uses a key-value system to refer to configuration settings.

Each compressor may find specific configuration settings for its specific compressor with settings beginning with its compressor id as prefix (i.e. configurations for SZ begin with `sz:`).  [Refer to the specific compressors documentation](build/Compressors.md) for further documentation for each settings.

+ Use the `io:`, `metrics:` and `pressio:` where appropriate.
+ Avoid unnecessary casts.  Prefer C++ style casts where required.
+ Prefer full names to abbreviations.
+ Do not contribute dead code or code that has been commented out.
+ Please read the semantics for each of the functions that you provide
  implementations of and conform to these requirements.  If they are unclear,
  open an issue, and we will try to clarify the ambiguity.
+ Prefer the greatest level of thread safety possible for your plugin.  Avoid
  global state shared between plugin instances where possible.
+ Option names in `get_options` and `set_options` should be `snake_case`
+ The options in CMake should be `BIG_SNAKE_CASE` and follow naming conventions
  used for the other options
+ When adding a enum option strongly consider adding a `${enum_name}_str`
  option and configuration entry that accept strings to set the enum and list
  the values of the enum respectively.  See the SZ plugin for an example of
  this.
+ When setting returning an error or warning, alway use the `set_error`
  function.
